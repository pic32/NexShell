# NexShell
A Unix style shell interface that uses the FatFs for a file system and a virtual file system.

The best way to explain this right now is that it is a shell like the microshell overlaid on an actual file system supported by the FatFs.

There will be an OS added and support for Unix style pipes so file/command output can be pipped into another file/command.

There will also be support for devices in the dev folder.

First port will be unknown, right now it is just a VS 2022 RAM drive with some virtual files supported in dev (no I/O devices at this time).

This is still a work in progress with no official first release.
